                We originally thought about integrating smart sensors into some of the existing structures of the garden, but 
                after speaking to some of the garden volunteers we seen that we could create a hydroponics system that people 
                could have at home. This is where the hydroponics in a box was born.

                I went and spoke to the volunteers of the Maxwell community garden about what we planned for the project and to get feedback from 
                them on what they would like to see. This is where the idea of a small-scale hydroponics system came about so people could replicate it 
                and have it within their homes, balconies, and allotments.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                From here I went away head spinning with ideas. We planned on using BBC micro:bits to code the system as the students we were working 
                with all had experience programming them. I 1st of all ordered a fairly pricey hydroponics kit using the micro:bit to give everyone 
                involved an idea of components that could be used. 
              </p>

                I went back to the community garden group with a plethora of electronics and micro:bits including the small hydroponics kit that I had 
                purchased. 
              </p>

                The gardening group was excited to see what we could create over the next few weeks/months. We decided the small kit was a great way of 
                seeing how all the electronic components, lights, water pump, etc could work together but it needed to be bigger to be of much use for 
                growing anything other than cress.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                So I took all this information to a group of 4 female Morgan Academy engineering students to see what we could come up with. They had 
                already been given a slight brief from their teacher of what we were trying to accomplish. We discussed ways that we could make a small 
                kit that was able to be broken down and stored when it wasn’t in use. 
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                I left them with the task of thinking about how this could be accomplished.

                I went to meet with the gardening group with the small micro:bit hydroponics kit as a few wanted to have a go at programming it. So we 
                ran a quick introduction to the micro:bit and worked through coding the lights of the hydroponic kit.  
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                I also caught up with the engineering students from Morgan Academy where they came up with the idea of the hydroponics system being 
                housed within a box.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                The box could hold the water a seed tray with the plants can sit on top of this with a wooden frame built up around it and the lid of the 
                box can have the LED lights attached to it and sits on top of the wooden frame to provide enough light to the plants. The wooden frame 
                will be cut to lengths that can fit within the box along with all the electronic components when the hydroponics system is not in use. 
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                The students also started exploring programming the LED strips for the lighting using a BBC micro:bit. They also had the idea of using 
                another one to control the hydroponics system.   
              </p>

                Back with the gardening group at the Maxwell Center where I explained what the Morgan Academy students had come up with. The gardening 
                group liked the sound of it. They also then got thinking that it would be a good idea to be able to control certain parts of the 
                hydroponics system individually and have fail-safe features. For instance, the kit was able to alert us when the water level was getting 
                too low for the pump to cope with. We thought this could be done with the LED strip for instance the lights could start turning yellow 
                when the water was getting too low and when the water level was drastically low the lights would go red and the pump would turn off.   
              </p>

                After this meeting, I could see that the project was going to grow bigger than we thought, and the micro:bit wouldn’t be able to handle 
                all the components and programming. 
              </p>

              <p class="mt-3 text-base text-gray-500 sm:mt-5 sm:text-lg sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto md:mt-5 md:text-xl lg:mx-0">
                I went away for a few weeks to order the components for the hydroponics system and figure out how we could control it all.

                I decided to use a Raspberry Pi Pico with Wifi capabilities. This way there would be enough pins to attach the electronics to and we 
                could develop the project in the future to contain a web app where the system could be controlled remotely and there could be a screen 
                displaying a dashboard of the hydroponics system within the maxwell center where people could see the temperature and water pump status. 
                They could even turn the lights on and off from here as well.

                I now had a prototype of the hydroponics system and all the electronics to show the volunteers at the community garden. They loved it and

                By this point, we had lost our group from Morgan Academy due to exam season coming up and the students found their lunch breaks were

                Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water instead. The plants are grown 
                in a controlled environment, typically indoors or in a greenhouse, and the water is carefully monitored and 
                adjusted to provide the necessary nutrients. This method has become increasingly popular in recent years due to 
                its sustainability and efficiency. Within our system we are still using a substrate to hold the plants.

                We would also like to eventually use the system with different substrates, lighting and plants. We will also be thinking of different ways

                make sure you sign up to our mailing list to find out about future updates.
